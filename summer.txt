I'll compare you to a summer day
You're prettier and sunnier than that
The strong wind. May's buds drop
Summer is too short

Sometimes the sun is so hot
Sometimes I'm covered by a golden face
I don't want to change things by chance or by nature
Even if you go to everything beautiful
The everlasting summer that you have will not fade
Your beauty never goes away

Death will fall before you
I will live with the time in the immortal song

As long as humans breathe and see with their eyes
I will live this song and give you life
